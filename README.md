 # Operators Assignment Questions
 
 Q1: (Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit) Write a program that reads a Celsius degree in
a double value from the console, then converts it to Fahrenheit and displays the
result. The formula for the conversion is as follows:
fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * celsius + 32
Q2: (Compute the volume of a cylinder) Write a program that reads in the radius
and length of a cylinder and computes the area and volume using the following
formulas:
area = radius * radius * pi
volume = area * length

Q3. (Financial application: calculate tips) Write a program that reads the subtotal
and the gratuity rate, then computes the gratuity and total. For example, if the
user enters 10 for subtotal and 15% for gratuity rate, the program displays $1.5
as gratuity and $11.5 as total.

Q4. (Sum the digits in an integer) Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and
1000 and adds all the digits in the integer. For example, if an integer is 932, the
sum of all its digits is 14.
Hint: Use the % operator to extract digits, and use the / operator to remove the
extracted digit. For instance, 932 % 10 = 2 and 932 / 10 = 93

Q5. (Find the number of years) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
minutes (e.g., 1 billion), and displays the number of years and days for the minutes.
For simplicity, assume a year has 365 days.

Q6: (Health application: computing BMI) Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of
health on weight. It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and
dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that prompts the
user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and displays the BMI. Note
that one pound is 0.45359237 kilograms and one inch is 0.0254 meters.

Q7. (Geometry: distance of two points) Write a program that prompts the user to enter
two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and displays their distance between them.

Q8: (Print a table) Write a program that displays the following table. Cast floatingpoint
numbers into integers.
a 		b 		pow(a, b)
1 		2 		1
2 		3 		8
3 		4 		81
4 		5 		1024
5 		6 		15625s

# Control Statements Assignment 2 (Programs 2a, 2b,...)

1. Write a program to find factorial?
Description: Factorial of any number is the product of an integer and all the integers below it for example factorial of 4 is 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24. 

2. Write a program to reverse number?
Description : Reverse number means reverse the position of all digits of any number. For example reverse of 839 is 938. 
Hint: For this program you need modulus operator concept and while loop, while loop is used for check condition and modulus used for find the remainder.

3. Write a program to print Fibonacci Series?
Description : Fibonacci series is in the form of 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,...... 
Hint: To find this series we add two previous terms/digits and get next term/number

4.Write a program to check given number is Armstrong number or not?
Description: Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits is equal to the number itself.
For example: 
Three Digits Armstrong number is 153, 1 ^ 3 + 5 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3 = 153 
Four Digits Armstrong number is 1634, 1 ^ 4 + 6 ^ 4 + 3 ^ 4 + 4 ^ 4 + = 1634

5. Write a program to Find Largest Number Among Three Numbers
Input three number from user and compare these number with each others and find largest number among these three numbers. 

# Control Statements Assignment 3 (Programs 3a, 3b ,....)

1. Find largest number among three numbers using ternary operator?
2. Write a program to check the given number is palindrome or not?
Descritpion : A Palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. Like 16461, for example: we take 121 and reverse it, after revers it is same as original number.
